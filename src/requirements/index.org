* Application:  A web-based directory of users

 The application is a simple directory of users and some related
 information (name and email).  The system has users.  There is a
 special user called =admin-user=.  Once a user is logged in, the
 system allows for the following /operations/

  1. Viewing the details of a user,
  2. Creating a user,
  3. Updating the details of that user,
  4. Deleting a user.  

All interaction is via a login session.  That is, users need
to log in before they can perform any operation.  Which
operation may be executed on what entity depends on both
that entity and the user who is logged in.  For example, if
user =u= is logged in, he/she may modify the details of user
=v= iff either =u = v= or =u = admin=.

The rest of the sections have more detailed requirements. 

* Users
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user
:END: 
** Type
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-type
:END: 
 The system has users.
** Email-address
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: email-address
:END: 
   Each user has an email address (string that corresponds to a valid
   email addr).
** Email
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: email-identity
:END: 
   Email identifies a user.  Two users with the same email are the
   same users.
** Name
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-name
:END: 
   Each user has a Name (string).

* Roles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: role
:END:
** Type 
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: role-type
:END: 
 There are two kinds of roles: =admin= and =user=. 

** User role identity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-role 
:END: 
   Each user is mapped to exactly one role, either =admin= or =user=.

** Access privileges
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: access-privileges
:END: 
   Each role determines what data access privileges are available to
   the user:

  - User :: A user with role =user= may  modify
       data related only to that user.  He/She may view (but
       not modify) other users' data. 

  - Admin :: A user with role =admin= may view or modify the
       data belonging to that user or any other user.  A
       user logged in as =admin= may also create and delete
       users.  A user is not allowed to delete his/her
       account.

* Sessions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: session
:END: 
** User login
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-login
:END: 
   Users are required to login into the system.  

** Login session
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: login-session
:END: 
   Once the user is logged in into the system, the system creates a
   /login/ session.

** Operation permission
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: op-perm
:END: 
   Operations are permitted only if the actor is logged in to the
   system.

** Number of sessions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: one-session
:END: 
   Users can have at most one session at a given time.

* Questions/scenarios
** Deleting oneself?  
- Question :: Can a user delete himself/herself?
- Ans :: No

** No user with admin role? 

- Question :: Is it possible for the system to have no user
     with role admin?

- Answer :: No.  There is at least one user in the system
     with role =admin=.  This is ensured by configuring the
     system with an initial user with role =admin=. 

** Multiple sessions for same user?   

- Question :: Is it possible for a user to be simultaneously
     logged in into the system in two different sessions?

- Answer :: No.
